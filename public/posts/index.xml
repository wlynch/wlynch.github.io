      <description>So logging in via X11 sucks. The problem with this is that you don&amp;rsquo;t know where the machine is and what address it is on.

export PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND=&amp;quot;-oLogLevel=Error&amp;quot;  </description>

      <description>FAQ What&amp;rsquo;s a shell? A shell is a way to interact with your operating system via a text based system. This allows you to do useful things like fast searches and scripting. Since it is a minimal interface, it makes it great to use across network connections.
